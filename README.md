#Website Template

###For E-bureauet frontend developer collaboration

The aim of this project is to create our own basic frontend template as foundation for all future websites we will develop. This template should conform to the best practices and standards.

Once you have a cloned or forked repository of this, you need to open up your command line interface and type in:

```
npm install
```
and then
```
bower install
```

Doing so will download all dependencies this project requires automatically.
